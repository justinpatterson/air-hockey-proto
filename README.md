# air-hockey-proto

This is a project made in about 3-4 hours to recreate the mechanics of Air Hockey with my current abilities in Unity3D.  Feel free to check it out, and use anything if useful! 

There are some major elements that need fixing or additional work:
-- the Player and AI inputs should be unteathered from one another in separate child classes is the most important one.  
-- I have some extra rigged characters and stuff in there (a royalty free santa claus) because I was hoping to get IK character interactions with the strikers but haven't taken the time to do so yet.
-- Some behaviors are unpolished, like the AI attacking the puck and the game over logic (needs to pause the game and such so things no longer move)
-- Other minor enhancements should be made like scaling movement by Time.deltaTime

Enjoy!
